@article{hilbig2010reconsidering,
	Abstract = {In several recent reviews, authors have argued for the pervasive use
	of fast-and-frugal heuristics in human judgment. They have provided
	an overview of heuristics and have reiterated findings corroborating
	that such heuristics can be very valid strategies leading to high
	accuracy. They also have reviewed previous work that implies that
	simple heuristics are actually used by decision makers. Unfortunately,
	concerning the latter point, these reviews appear to be somewhat
	incomplete. More important, previous conclusions have been derived
	from investigations that bear some noteworthy methodological limitations.
	I demonstrate these by proposing a new heuristic and provide some
	novel critical findings. Also, I review some of the relevant literature
	often not-or only partially-considered. Overall, although some fast-and-frugal
	heuristics indeed seem to predict behavior at times, there is little
	to no evidence for others. More generally, the empirical evidence
	available does not warrant the conclusion that heuristics are pervasively
	used.},

@article{payne2007discretionary,
	Abstract = {When participants allocated time across 2 tasks (in which they generated
	as many words as possible from a fixed set of letters), they made
	frequent switches. This allowed them to allocate more time to the
	more productive task (i.e., the set of letters from which more words
	could be generated) even though times between the last word and the
	switch decision ("giving-up times") were higher in the less productive
	task. These findings were reliable across 2 experiments using Scrabble
	tasks and 1 experiment using word-search puzzles. Switch decisions
	appeared relatively unaffected by the ease of the competing task
	or by explicit information about tasks' potential gain. The authors
	propose that switch decisions reflected a dual orientation to the
	experimental tasks. First, there was a sensitivity to continuous
	rate of return--an information-foraging orientation that produced
	a tendency to switch in keeping with R. F. Green's (1984) rule and
	a tendency to stay longer in more rewarding tasks. Second, there
	was a tendency to switch tasks after subgoal completion. A model
	combining these tendencies predicted all the reliable effects in
	the experimental data.},

@article{remington2009selective,
	Abstract = {It has been suggested that the locus of selective attention (early
	vs. late in processing) is dependent on the perceptual load of the
	task. When perceptual load is low, irrelevant distractors are processed
	(late selection), whereas when perceptual load is high, distractor
	interference disappears (early selection). Attentional abnormalities
	have long been reported within autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and
	this study is the first to examine the effect of perceptual load
	on selective attention in this population. Fourteen adults with ASD
	and 23 adults without ASD performed a selective attention task with
	varying perceptual loads. Compared with the non-ASD group, the ASD
	group required higher levels of perceptual load to successfully ignore
	irrelevant distractors; moreover, the ASD group did not show any
	general reduction in performance speed or accuracy. These results
	suggest enhanced perceptual capacity in the ASD group and are consistent
	with previous observations regarding superior visual search abilities
	among individuals with ASD.},

@article{todd2000precis,
	Abstract = {How can anyone be rational in a world where knowledge is limited,
	time is pressing, and deep thought is often an unattainable luxury?
	Traditional models of unbounded rationality and optimization in cognitive
	science, economics, and animal behavior have tended to view decision-makers
	as possessing supernatural powers of reason, limitless knowledge,
	and endless time. But understanding decisions in the real world requires
	a more psychologically plausible notion of bounded rationality. In
	Simple heuristics that make us smart (Gigerenzer et al. 1999), we
	explore fast and frugal heuristics--simple rules in the mind's adaptive
	toolbox for making decisions with realistic mental resources. These
	heuristics can enable both living organisms and artificial systems
	to make smart choices quickly and with a minimum of information by
	exploiting the way that information is structured in particular environments.
	In this pr\'{e}cis, we show how simple building blocks that control
	information search, stop search, and make decisions can be put together
	to form classes of heuristics, including: ignorance-based and one-reason
	decision making for choice, elimination models for categorization,
	and satisficing heuristics for sequential search. These simple heuristics
	perform comparably to more complex algorithms, particularly when
	generalizing to new data--that is, simplicity leads to robustness.
	We present evidence regarding when people use simple heuristics and
	describe the challenges to be addressed by this research program.},
