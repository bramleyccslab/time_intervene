  abstract = {The term psi denotes anomalous processes of information or energy
	transfer that are currently unexplained in terms of known physical
	or biological mechanisms. Two variants of psi are precognition (conscious
	cognitive awareness) and premonition (affective apprehension) of
	a future event that could not otherwise be anticipated through any
	known inferential process. Precognition and premonition are themselves
	special cases of a more general phenomenon: the anomalous retroactive
	influence of some future event on an individual's current responses,
	whether those responses are conscious or nonconscious, cognitive
	or affective. This article reports 9 experiments, involving more
	than 1,000 participants, that test for retroactive influence by "time-reversing"
	well-established psychological effects so that the individual's responses
	are obtained before the putatively causal stimulus events occur.
	Data are presented for 4 time-reversed effects: precognitive approach
	to erotic stimuli and precognitive avoidance of negative stimuli;
	retroactive priming; retroactive habituation; and retroactive facilitation
	of recall. The mean effect size (d) in psi performance across all
	9 experiments was 0.22, and all but one of the experiments yielded
	statistically significant results. The individual-difference variable
	of stimulus seeking, a component of extraversion, was significantly
	correlated with psi performance in 5 of the experiments, with participants
	who scored above the midpoint on a scale of stimulus seeking achieving
	a mean effect size of 0.43. Skepticism about psi, issues of replication,
	and theories of psi are also discussed.},

  abstract = {The present paper evaluates the claim that abstract conceptual domains
	are structured through metaphorical mappings from domains grounded
	directly in experience. In particular, the paper asks whether the
	abstract domain of time gets its relational structure from the more
	concrete domain of space. Relational similarities between space and
	time are outlined along with several explanations of how these similarities
	may have arisen. Three experiments designed to distinguish between
	these explanations are described. The results indicate that (1) the
	domains of space and time do share conceptual structure, (2) spatial
	relational information is just as useful for thinking about time
	as temporal information, and (3) with frequent use, mappings between
	space and time come to be stored in the domain of time and so thinking
	about time does not necessarily require access to spatial schemas.
	These findings provide some of the first empirical evidence for Metaphoric
	Structuring. It appears that abstract domains such as time are indeed
	shaped by metaphorical mappings from more concrete and experiential
	domains such as space.}

  abstract = {A robust finding in social psychology is that people judge negative
	events as less likely to happen to themselves than to the average
	person, a behavior interpreted as showing that people are "unrealistically
	optimistic" in their judgments of risk concerning future life events.
	However, we demonstrate how unbiased responses can result in data
	patterns commonly interpreted as indicative of optimism for purely
	statistical reasons. Specifically, we show how extant data from unrealistic
	optimism studies investigating people's comparative risk judgments
	are plagued by the statistical consequences of sampling constraints
	and the response scales used, in combination with the comparative
	rarity of truly negative events. We conclude that the presence of
	such statistical artifacts raises questions over the very existence
	of an optimistic bias about risk and implies that to the extent that
	such a bias exists, we know considerably less about its magnitude,
	mechanisms, and moderators than previously assumed.},

  abstract = {In several recent reviews, authors have argued for the pervasive use
	of fast-and-frugal heuristics in human judgment. They have provided
	an overview of heuristics and have reiterated findings corroborating
	that such heuristics can be very valid strategies leading to high
	accuracy. They also have reviewed previous work that implies that
	simple heuristics are actually used by decision makers. Unfortunately,
	concerning the latter point, these reviews appear to be somewhat
	incomplete. More important, previous conclusions have been derived
	from investigations that bear some noteworthy methodological limitations.
	I demonstrate these by proposing a new heuristic and provide some
	novel critical findings. Also, I review some of the relevant literature
	often not-or only partially-considered. Overall, although some fast-and-frugal
	heuristics indeed seem to predict behavior at times, there is little
	to no evidence for others. More generally, the empirical evidence
	available does not warrant the conclusion that heuristics are pervasively
	used.},

  abstract = {To perform visual search, humans, like many mammals, encode a large
	field of view with retinas having variable spatial resolution, and
	then use high-speed eye movements to direct the highest-resolution
	region, the fovea, towards potential target locations. Good search
	performance is essential for survival, and hence mammals may have
	evolved efficient strategies for selecting fixation locations. Here
	we address two questions: what are the optimal eye movement strategies
	for a foveated visual system faced with the problem of finding a
	target in a cluttered environment, and do humans employ optimal eye
	movement strategies during a search? We derive the ideal bayesian
	observer for search tasks in which a target is embedded at an unknown
	location within a random background that has the spectral characteristics
	of natural scenes. Our ideal searcher uses precise knowledge about
	the statistics of the scenes in which the target is embedded, and
	about its own visual system, to make eye movements that gain the
	most information about target location. We find that humans achieve
	nearly optimal search performance, even though humans integrate information
	poorly across fixations. Analysis of the ideal searcher reveals that
	there is little benefit from perfect integration across fixations--much
	more important is efficient processing of information on each fixation.
	Apparently, evolution has exploited this fact to achieve efficient
	eye movement strategies with minimal neural resources devoted to
	memory.},

  abstract = {When participants allocated time across 2 tasks (in which they generated
	as many words as possible from a fixed set of letters), they made
	frequent switches. This allowed them to allocate more time to the
	more productive task (i.e., the set of letters from which more words
	could be generated) even though times between the last word and the
	switch decision ("giving-up times") were higher in the less productive
	task. These findings were reliable across 2 experiments using Scrabble
	tasks and 1 experiment using word-search puzzles. Switch decisions
	appeared relatively unaffected by the ease of the competing task
	or by explicit information about tasks' potential gain. The authors
	propose that switch decisions reflected a dual orientation to the
	experimental tasks. First, there was a sensitivity to continuous
	rate of return--an information-foraging orientation that produced
	a tendency to switch in keeping with R. F. Green's (1984) rule and
	a tendency to stay longer in more rewarding tasks. Second, there
	was a tendency to switch tasks after subgoal completion. A model
	combining these tendencies predicted all the reliable effects in
	the experimental data.},

	vs. late in processing) is dependent on the perceptual load of the
	task. When perceptual load is low, irrelevant distractors are processed
	(late selection), whereas when perceptual load is high, distractor
	interference disappears (early selection). Attentional abnormalities
	have long been reported within autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and
	this study is the first to examine the effect of perceptual load
	on selective attention in this population. Fourteen adults with ASD
	and 23 adults without ASD performed a selective attention task with
	varying perceptual loads. Compared with the non-ASD group, the ASD
	group required higher levels of perceptual load to successfully ignore
	irrelevant distractors; moreover, the ASD group did not show any
	general reduction in performance speed or accuracy. These results
	suggest enhanced perceptual capacity in the ASD group and are consistent
	with previous observations regarding superior visual search abilities
	among individuals with ASD.},

  abstract = {How can anyone be rational in a world where knowledge is limited,
	time is pressing, and deep thought is often an unattainable luxury?
	Traditional models of unbounded rationality and optimization in cognitive
	science, economics, and animal behavior have tended to view decision-makers
	as possessing supernatural powers of reason, limitless knowledge,
	and endless time. But understanding decisions in the real world requires
	a more psychologically plausible notion of bounded rationality. In
	Simple heuristics that make us smart (Gigerenzer et al. 1999), we
	explore fast and frugal heuristics--simple rules in the mind's adaptive
	toolbox for making decisions with realistic mental resources. These
	heuristics can enable both living organisms and artificial systems
	to make smart choices quickly and with a minimum of information by
	exploiting the way that information is structured in particular environments.
	In this pr\'{e}cis, we show how simple building blocks that control
	information search, stop search, and make decisions can be put together
	to form classes of heuristics, including: ignorance-based and one-reason
	decision making for choice, elimination models for categorization,
	and satisficing heuristics for sequential search. These simple heuristics
	perform comparably to more complex algorithms, particularly when
	generalizing to new data--that is, simplicity leads to robustness.
	We present evidence regarding when people use simple heuristics and
	describe the challenges to be addressed by this research program.},
